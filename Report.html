3. Sara Kay’s Portfolio
<br><br>https://www.sarakays.com/
<br><br>
Sara Kay’s portfolio site showcases a strikingly visual and modern design, with an emphasis on artistic expression and creativity. The site’s engaging visuals, videos and clear presentation of her work inspired the importance of a visually appealing and entertaining layout of my own portfolio.

<br><br><br><br><br>
Accessibility
<br><br>
1. High Contrast and Text Resizing
<br><br>
My Web site features a high contrast color scheme between text and background to ensure readability for users with visual impairments, including those with color blindness. Additionally, the text is resizable through standard browser zoom functions, and the site uses relative units for font sizes rather than fixed units. High contrast helps users with low vision or color blindness to read content more easily, while text resizing options accommodate users with varying levels of visual acuity, making the content accessible to a broader audience.
<br><br>
2. Images
<br><br>
The images correlate to their purpose and are placed alongside text where they reinforce or illustrate the content of my web site. For instance, "clothing" has an image of a garment. The placement of the images is contextually relevant to the surrounding text or content, enhancing the visual support and understanding of my content.
<br><br>
3. Well-Structured Content, Headings and Subheadings
<br><br>
Using direct language to make content easier to understand for all users, including those with cognitive impairments or limited language skills. Organized my web page contents into easily navigable sections, improving readability and comprehension for all users, including those using screen readers or different devices.
<br><br><br><br><br>
Usability   
<br><br>
1. Responsive Design
<br><br>
My web site is designed to be fully responsive, with a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes, from desktop computers to smartphones and tablets.
The site uses flexible grids and layouts that adjust to different screen sizes
The Images and media are made to resize accordingly and maintain quality on any device.
The touch-friendly elements are designed for simple interaction on mobile devices, such as larger buttons and easily clickable links.
<br><br>
2. Navigation
<br><br>
My web site features clear and logical navigation structure in every page, helping users to easily find what they’re looking for. This includes a straightforward menu layout and prominent navigation links.
<br><br>
3. Action Buttons
<br><br>
The Buttons are placed prominently on relevant pages, such as “Shop Now” button on the merch page, “submit” button on the services page, and “Send Message” button on the contact page. The buttons are designed with contrasting colors and clear, actionable texts. The buttons are strategically placed after key contents to prompt users at the right moments.
<br><br><br><br>
Learning
<br><br>
1. Adding Custom Fonts
<br><br>
I struggled with incorporating custom fonts into my website, which involved ensuring that the fonts were properly loaded and displayed across different browsers.
<br><br>
How I Solved It:
<br><br>
Learned Font Formats: I learned about different font formats in google search and how they affect browser compatibility. I used a service like Google Font links to add to the home page of my web site.
<br><br>
2. Placement of contents
<br><br>
I had difficulty ensuring that different content elements (such as text, images, and sections) were stacked correctly and appeared in the desired order.
<br><br>
How I Solved it:<br><br>
CSS Display Properties: I used CSS properties like display: flex; for creating flexible layouts. I tried several positions such as Position: Relative, to place my contents and ensure that they do not overlap each other. Other details that i added were margins and top: to control the spacings between each of my content.
<br><br>
3. Making Texts Wrap Around Images
<br><br>
I faced challenges making text wrap around images in a visually appealing way.
<br><br>
How I Solved It:
<br><br>
CSS Float Property: I used the float property to make text wrap around images.
Responsive Adjustments: I made sure to adjust the layout for smaller screens, often by using media queries to switch between floated and stacked layouts.
<br><br><br><br><br>
Evaluation I: What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful? Why?    
<br><br>
1. Navigation Success
<br><br>

Prominent Placement: Key navigation sites are positioned prominently, ensuring that they are easily accessible from any page.
<br><br>
