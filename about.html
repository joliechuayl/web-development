    <h1><br>Hello!<br><br>
    Thank you for coming here...</h1>
    <p><br><br>As a mom, I pour my heart into supporting the women and families I meet.
    <br>I hold an Honors degree from the University of London at SIM in Singapore, where i studied computer science, driven by its significance in the modern world.
    <br><br>While at university, I experienced an unexpected pregnancy, which led me to embrace motherhood while continuing my studies.
    <br><br>This period was filled with changes and anxieties, 
    but it helped me to understand the incredible capabilities of my body and  the power of a positive mindset in managing challenges.
    <br><br>With all the challenges I faced — People suggesting I should have an abortion, the father being absent and wanting the same, and dealing with financial stress. I really started to doubt what my body could handle. I knew the basics of labor from my studies, but I realized I needed to dig deeper and find more ways to prepare and support myself through this tough time.
   
    <br><br> This experience has deeply influenced my journey, particularly in supporting single parents.
    I wholeheartedly dedicate myself to caring for teens, women, and families, and I find great fulfillment in working across areas of maternity.
